# NutriLife - Final Capstone Project 2023
Food is one thing that cannot be separated from peopleâ€™s lives. But, food can affect everything such as the immune system and heart health, and many more. Eating food  that has imbalanced nutrition or isn't nutritious will cause problems like malnutrition or being overweight. So, The food we ate must have balanced nutrition and we as humans should know the nutrition we have eaten. 
So, we decided to make an application to control daily nutrition with some new features to help maintain health and food.
